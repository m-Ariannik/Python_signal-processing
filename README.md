# Python_signal-processing
Geomagnetic field signal processing 

This project stems from one of my Ph.D. projects at York University, Toronto, Canada. My PhD research helps to evaluate reliability of electrical power systems during severe solar storms. The attached python script allows calculating time derivative of geomagnetic field signals. The signal processing methods include denoising, despiking, and taking time-derivate of the geomagnetic signals dB/dt. All the methods are based on wavelet transforms. This project yields an accurate reliable dB/dt signals, compared to the uninterpretable noisy signals that is obtained without the use of techniques proposed in this project. The mathematical formulas along with the results are presented in an IEEE journal paper that can be reviewed on the following webpage:

If the plasma from a coronal mass ejection or solar flare takes the earth’s path, it interacts with earth’s magnetic field. As a result, low frequency electrical currents are induced along long power transmission lines. The resultant semi-dc current affects power system equipment and power transformers in particular. A geomagnetic storm caused a 9-hour backout in Quebec Canada in March 1989.
